# Building a Blog & Portfolio

## The process and tools I chose to build this website.

The modern landscape choosing tools to use for building a website is vast. There are so many options to choose from, and it can be overwhelming. 
Many Javascript frameworks have come and gone. 

Nowadays, you have to choose between React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, NextJS and many more. There's even things like HTMX which skirt the line between a framework and a library. 
Then you have to choose between a static site generator or a server-side rendered application.

## Why I chose NextJS

Initially, I had wanted to use GatsbyJS. I had used it before and was familiar with it. I had also heard of NextJS, but I had never used it.
After doing some research, I decided to go with NextJS since GatsbyJS has basically been abandoned by the maintainers. Which while sad,
does seem to happen quite often with open source projects.

The main thing I liked about Gatsby and now also NextJS was that it would give me the ability to use static site generation. It would also allow
me to use React, which I am very familiar with as well. Since React is probably the most widely used Javascript framework
(I can hear seasoned React devs screaming, "It's not a framework!") it's a wise choice to get accustomed to if I'm gunna look for a job in the industry.

The ability to use Markdown to write my blog posts was also a huge plus. While it can be a bit wonky at times, it's still a lot easier than writing HTML 
for every blog post. I also like that I can use React components in my Markdown files. This allows me to use things like PrismJS to highlight code blocks in the future.
