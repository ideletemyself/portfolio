# Serving Images and Other Media From a CDN in NextJS

## Switching to serving images and other media from a CDN and where the real gains come from.

In my journey creating this website and blog I was having real issues with image load times. Especially the images in my image sliders.
There was a 5-6 second delay before the images would load. I was using the NextJS Image component and I also installed the NPM packages
it recommended to use with it.
